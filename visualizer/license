1.3 Additional License Rights for SDK. In addition to the license granted above in
Section 1.1, the IPEVO CameraKit Software Development Kit (“CameraKit

IPEVO’s hardware camera products. This additional license right is conditioned
upon your compliance with the distribution requirements and license restrictions
described in Section 2.3 (Distribution Requirements). IPEVO has no obligation to
provide or to continue to provide any support for the SDK. Further, subject to the
license restrictions described in Section 2, IPEVO may provide a text-based PDF
